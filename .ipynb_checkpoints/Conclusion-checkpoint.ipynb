    "After first normalizing our `Price` variable through a log transform, I determined that several instances of multicoloinearity existed. As `grade` had the highest Pearson coefficient with our desired `pricelog` variable, when I began to deselect possible variables to incorporate, I deselected those which had a high correlation with `grade`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To select variables from the subset, I made use of SciKit Learn's recursive feature elimination, which deselects variables with smaller coefficients in favor of those with more impact. Through this method, I selected `grade`, `waterfront`, `bathrooms`, `condition`, and `lat`. I tested this proposed model with StatsModels and obtained an $R^2$ of 0.68. Through trial and error, I found that adding `yr_built` increased $R^2$ to 0.72, and decided to incorporate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check for overfitting, I ran the proposed model again through SciKit Learn's train-test split and found that the proposed model returned similar MSE values on both the train and test set, suggesting that the model wasn't overfit; and I found that the $R^2$ regularly sat above 0.70, suggesting it kept the previously observed fit. I further used SciKit Learn and MatplotLib to test the distribution of our residuals on both the train and test sets and found that the distribution of both was normal and fit the assumption of homoscedacticity."

    "#### The Latitude Coefficient\n",
    "\n",
    "`latitude` has the largest coefficient, but `grade` has stronger correlation to our desired variable. This is primarily driven by the fact that `latitude` is incremental on a very, very small scale. As you can see on the maps derived in the prior notebook, the entirety of King County only spans the latitude of about 47.1N to 47.8N - in other words, it's possible to travel across the entire county and only move up 0.7 degrees, so, it needs a bigger bolster.\n",
    "\n",
    "`latitude` is also important to King County in that the spread of the population is primarily vertical along the cost. Using Latitude will successfully trim house sales into smaller clusters that may reval more information about localized pricing. As was shown previously, price of a house increases as you go further north - that's not surprising, as you're getting closer to Seattle as you go farther north. As a result of both of these features, the latitude coefficient is both positive and exceptionally large.\n",
