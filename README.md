# An Analysis and Application of the Modified King County Dataset



### Overview

To conclude Module 1 of FlatIron's Online Data Science Program, Flatiron has provided us with a modified dataset that closely resembles the real world "House Sales in King County" dataset provided on Kaggle. FlatIron has modified this dataset to include null values, placeholder values, outlier values, and other 'messy data' features to give program participants an opportunity to use tools they've been given to both 1) appropriately deal with the data and 2) derive and test a basic multilinear regression model.

This notebook will outline a model that aims to predict price at sale for a home in King County, and resolve through exploratory data analysis questions which a potential home builder would ask in conceptualizing a new development to evaluate returns.


### Model/Use-Case Perspective

To consider the perspective of a potential home builder, this journal will seek to answer the following questions:

1. What are the main drivers of sale price? Are they controllable?
2. How much do n bedrooms, n bathrooms, and n floors impact sale price?
3. Where are new developments happening? How much are they generally selling for?
